# htmlbasictest1
This is a solution of a HTML basic test which I have created. This solution contains a html web-page containing an image upon clicking it will open the mail server. An embedded animate video in the web-page. A basic contact us form. JS query has been used for the submit button. An external CSS file has been used for basic styling
